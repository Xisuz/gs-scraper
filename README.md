# gs-scraper

The idea is to build an app that scrapes data from local Craigslist, various websites, etc for deals on the types of items I'm looking for. Mainly, I'm a retro video game collector so I will be developing this to find deals on retro gaming stuff or even garage sales with listings that mention certain key words that I might like to visit in hopes of finding retro gaming stuff.
